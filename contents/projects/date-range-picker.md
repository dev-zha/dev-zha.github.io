## Objective:

Create a functional date range picker component using MUI date picker without the need for a licensed MUI date range picker.

## Features:

- **Date Selection**: Allow users to pick start and end dates for a range.
- **Validation**: Implement date validation to ensure the end date is after the start date.

## Technology Stack:

- React.js
- Material-UI (MUI) for the date picker component

## Conclusion:

Material-UI (MUI) provides an excellent set of components for React applications, making UI development a breeze. While there are licensed versions of date range pickers available, creating a custom date range picker using the standard MUI date picker is a rewarding and educational journey.
