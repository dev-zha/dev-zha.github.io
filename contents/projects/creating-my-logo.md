## Introduction:

Creating a logo involves a mix of creativity and precision. I start with my brand's initials, experimenting with shapes until I find the right combination. This process includes sketching on paper and refining the details. Finally, I bring the design to the digital realm for a polished finish. It's a journey of exploration and artistic refinement.

## Step-by-Step Drawing Guide:

### 1. The Foundation - A Triangle

Begin with a basic triangle shape, setting the stage for the logo creation.

### 2. Subtracting Shapes Method
![Subtracted Shape](/images/projects/creating-my-logo/triangle-subtract.png)

Employ a subtractive approach by creating a smaller triangle within the original, subtracting `200px` from `124px`.

### 3. Multiplying Triangles

Replicate this subtracted shape thrice, adjusting rotations and positions to create a dynamic visual.

### 4. Unifying Elements

Merge the triangles into a unified form, resulting in the final logo.

## Meaningful Elements:

### 1. Individual Representation

Each triangle symbolizes a word from my name - "Zaw," "Htet," and "Aung."

### 2. Acronymic Formation

The combined triangles *(final logo)* form an acronymic representation of my full name - "Zaw Htet Aung."

## Showcasing the Final Result:

### 1. Logo in Action - Mockups
Visualize the logo on various surfaces, showcasing its adaptability and versatility.

## Conclusion:

In the world of logo design, creativity knows no bounds. My logo, a fusion of triangles, not only represents my name but also encapsulates the essence of my brand. The process, from inception to the final product, is a testament to the artistry and thought invested in creating a visual identity that resonates with my brand's personality.
